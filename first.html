<h1>ABOUT PROKABADDI</h1>
<p><h3>Pro Kabaddi is a ground-breaking initiative by Mashal Sports Pvt. Ltd and Star India Pvt. Ltd. Ever since its inception in 2014, The League has revolutionised the sport of kabaddi with stunning innovations, making it an aspirational sport for players and fans alike. Backed by the Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI), and supported by participating members of the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF) and the Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF), the league has witnessed tremendous growth over the past seasons.

Mashal Sports and STAR India have jointly worked towards elevating the sport of kabaddi to an international standard with new and exciting innovations in the rules and how the game is viewed, thus heralding in a new era for kabaddi. They infused new life into the sport by bringing it to the major metropolitan cities of India along with regions where kabaddi was yet to gain a foothold. VIVO Pro Kabaddi now has unprecedented participation from various parts of the country owing to the outreach over the past seasons and the advent of new programmes pioneered by Mashal Sports to encourage young talent from across the country. Kabaddi is now also seen as a viable career option by various aspiring players in India and abroad.

The addition of four new teams in the fifth edition of the league made VIVO Pro Kabaddi India’s biggest sports league in terms of geographical representation and number of teams. The new sides – Gujarat Fortunegiants, Haryana Steelers, Tamil Thalaivas and U.P. Yoddha made the competition all the more intense and the kabaddi all the more exciting.

This season the kabaddi superstars will go toe-to-toe once again promising some high-octane Panga on the mat.</h3></p>
